# My First Website Project

This is my first website project, containing the frontend-only implementation. The project is built using Vue3 and related technologies, and I have also set up an automated deployment script. Every time I push changes to the repository, GitHub Actions automatically runs the script to deploy the project. The deployed content is available via GitHub Pages.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3**: Used for building reactive and modular user interfaces.
- **Vue Router**: Handles the routing for the multi-page application.
- **Vuex**: State management for sharing data between components.
- **Naive UI**: A modern and elegant UI component library for Vue.
- **JavaScript**: Core language for handling the logic and functionality.

## Project Structure

│   ├── App.vue       # Root component
│   ├── main.js       # Entry file
└── index.html        # HTML template
```

## Automated Deployment

The project integrates GitHub Actions for automatic deployment. Every time code is pushed to the main branch, the following process is triggered:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build the project: `npm run build`
3. Deploy the built files from the `dist` directory to GitHub Pages.
